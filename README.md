# Dream Catcher App
Have you ever woken up from a dream and thought "Wow, I want to remember this dream, but I know if I don't log it now, I'll never remember."? Well, this application is perfect for you. Keep your phone or computer by your bed, and as soon as you wake up from that dream, log it with the Dream Catcher App! You can log the dream, go back and edit the dream, delete the dream if you just don't want to remember anymore, and go back and read through those dreams. No more trying to rack your brain for that dream you had 2 weeks ago. They are all here and organized in your dream log. This is the server side of the Dream Catcher app which works with the client side for full functionality. Refer to links below.

## Planning
I started this project by first coming up with an idea that I found interesting and also useful to a user. I created an ERD and wireframes for my project for reference. To start the actual coding portion of the project I began by downloading the browser template provided, and built my routes and testing with cURL scripts along the way. I then moved on to the server side of the application for full functionality.

## Unsolved Problems
In future versions, I would like to rearrange in order to add a subdoc for the user's sleep. I would like to add more information about the user's sleep relating to that dream. I would like to do more with styling as well.
